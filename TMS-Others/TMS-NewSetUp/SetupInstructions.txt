Note:
When testing assigning of map to publisher in your localhost, please take note that you will get an error when you click the button "Assign Map to Publisher".
The error is HTTP Error 404.0 - Not Found and your URL is http://localhost/CallActivity/Details?id=0
To make this work, simply add the website name you setup in IIS here http://localhost/YOUR_WEBSITE_NAME/CallActivity/Details?id=0
In this case for example, if the website name is TMSTest then the URL should be http://localhost/TMSTest/CallActivity/Details?id=0
